### About The Project
Develop a portfolio website that showcase my skills and talents to potential employer.

### User Story

    AS AN employer
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

###Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
